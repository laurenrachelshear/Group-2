Group Meeting - March 2, 8:00 p.m.

All interested in doing something with Twitter

Ideas Considered:
- Sports
- GW Basketball (final two minutes of game)
- Scraping menus of D.C. restaurants
- Cherry blossoms


Idea:
- Create a Twitterbot that aggregates all of the stories or tweets about the Cherry Blossom Festival and Cherry Blossoms in D.C. 
- Keywords: Cherry Blossoms, Cherry Blossom Festival, peak bloom, #CherryBlossoms #CherryBlossom Festival, etc.
- This would be useful as the Cherry Blossoms are due to bloom this spring, and people have conversations about this on Twitter year round.

Data source: Tweets that contain words or phrases pertaining to the Cherry Blossom Festival
