Group Meeting - March 2, 8:00 p.m.All interested in doing something with TwitterIdeas Considered:- Sports- GW Basketball (final two minutes of game)- Scraping menus of D.C. restaurants- Cherry blossomsIdea:- Create a Twitterbot that aggregates all of the stories or tweets about the Cherry Blossom Festival and Cherry Blossoms in D.C. - Keywords: Cherry Blossoms, Cherry Blossom Festival, peak bloom, #CherryBlossoms #CherryBlossom Festival, etc.- This would be useful as the Cherry Blossoms are due to bloom this spring, and people have conversations about this on Twitter year round.UPDATE:

Our new idea is creating a Twitterbot and accompanying website to create a resource that estimates how many people are walking around the Tidal Basin and what the weather is like. This would be helpful for people who are thinking about visiting the tidal basin, but are wary of weather/crowds.

The data sources would be 1) tweets where people have "checked in" at the tidal basin or tweeted about it and 2) a weather report, we could probably use weather.com. The bot could run every hour using these sources. The output would be something like "At 300 people at the tidal basin. 75 degrees, 5 percent humidity."
