Group Meeting April 4, 2017

This week, our group met to solidify exactly what we want to do for the final project. In our previous update, we mentioned creating a Twitterbot that would aggregate all of the stories or tweets about the Cherry Blossom Festival. However, as you mentioned in your email to us, the Cherry Blossom Festival is happening this week (and we want to make our project more relevant). 

Revised Version of Project Idea

Twitterbot - “By the Basin” - @bythebasin

By the Basin will be a Twitterbot that aggregates all of the stories or tweets about activities happening in and around the Tidal Basin (i.e. National Mall vicinity). This includes all events leading up to and during the Cherry Blossom Festival, as well as activities that occur year round. Whether it’s the paddle boats over the summer or D.C.’s hottest food truck parked by the Jefferson - By the Basin aims to keep the D.C. flaneur or tourist involved with what is happening in the nation’s capital. 

By the Basin features:
- tweeting/retweeting people and organizations that are promoting activities around the Basin (starting a conversation)
- using geographic data to aggregate the tweets about these events
- also tweeting weather information
